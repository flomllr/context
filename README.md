## Context â€“ Taking multitasking to the next level

The MVP built of the **Context** app is made for the macOS operating system.

### Prerequisites

The following steps need to be taken to run this application:

* Be on macOS.
* Clone this repository.
* Have Node.js installed.

### How to run

Run `./start` in the root folder of the repository.

### How to use

#### Switching context

There are three default presets: Design, Uni and Coding. They just serve as a
demo. There is three different ways of switching context:

* If you own a Logitech MX Master mouse, you can use the side scrollwheel to select different contexts and the thumb button to select one.
* You can use `CMD+Option+Arrow Keys` to navigate the contexts, and enter to select one.
* You can use your mouse to click on a desired context.

**Context** can be accessed at any time by using `CMD+Option+Arrow Keys` or scrolling with the side scrollwheel on your MX Master.

#### Saving new context

You can save all windows you have currently opened and their respective position on your screen by selecting the *Save Current Profile* option in the **Context** menu. Your context will have been saved and is now available in the menu.
